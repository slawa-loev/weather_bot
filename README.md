# weather_bot

This is the code repo for Cyrus, a chat bot who can give you the weather for a location and date, and a few more funny things.

You can visit and try out Cyrus [here](https://cyrusbot.wixsite.com/home). 

Cyrus works thanks to the Python code you find here, Google Dialogflow CX and some APIs.
